# BLOG

## Purpose
I am taking notes from the field in a form of blog posts. These might be beneficial to others. 

## Why here
I was tired of messing up with Wordpress and Jekyll. This is the outcome.

My initial requirements were:
1. Simple CMS - I want to login somewhere and catch my idea immediately. Aka WordPress. No jekyll, git etc.
2. Managed - I always gravitate to managed solutions. No single thing to manage. No WordPress servers, S3 buckets etc.
3. Free - I don't necessarily need to pay for hosting a couple of technical notes
4. Graphical way to see my posts - I am more comfortable with that feedback

I've figured out that I can just create bunch of markdown files directly on GitHub, thus using it as my CMS. Anywhere, anytime, it's managed, free, I can make countless edits to my posts if neccessary, I have preview before I commit. And as a bonus, markdown files can be easily handed over to another system.

I don't need any structure because posts can be referred from Google. Nobody really reads blogs today. I may put just a list of links here.
